# Inception Engine
An independent work attemping to implement some components of a game engine from scratch. Use Vulkan API to render, GLM library for math 
computation, ASSIMP for read FBX data, Fast Noise to generate Perlin noise.

**Enabled Features:**

  * Indexed rendering
  
  * Base color texture
  
  * Point light with ambient and specular
  
  * Character control
  
  * Camera control and follow character
  
  * Load model to scene
  
  * Load skeleton hierarchy, bone information, and key framing animation data
  
  * Play skeleton animation
  
  * IK animation of the right arm of the character, using FABRIK algorithm
  
  * Socket system such that actor can be attached to a socket or bone so that the attachment will move
  with its parent
  
  * Marching Cube algorithm for rendering predefined surface
  
  * Randomly generating terrain using Perlin Noise and rendering using Marching Cube



**Implementing Features:**

  * Sky box
  
  * Audio
  
  * Capsule collision and terrain collision
  
  * Terrain height map
  
  * Depth detection
  
  * Animation control and animation notify
  
  * Multisampling
  
  * Multitexturing
  
  * Simple ray tracer
