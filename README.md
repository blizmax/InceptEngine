# Inception Engine
An independent work attemping to implement some components of a game engine from scratch. Use Vulkan API to render, GLM library for math 
computation, ASSIMP for read FBX data, Fast Noise to generate Perlin noise.

**Enabled Features (from new to old):**

* Cube map and skybox

* Randomly generating terrain using Perlin Noise and rendering using Marching Cube

* Marching Cube algorithm for rendering predefined surface

* IK animation of the right arm of the character, using FABRIK algorithm

* Socket system which enables actors to be attached to a socket or bone so that the attached actor will move
  with its parent
    
* Play skeleton animation
      
* Load skeleton hierarchy, bone information, and key framing animation data

* Load model to scene

* Camera control and follow character

* Character control

* Point light with ambient and specular

* Base color texture

* Indexed rendering



**Implementing Features:**

  
  * Audio
  
  * Capsule collision and terrain collision
  
  * Terrain height map
  
  * Depth detection
  
  * Animation control and animation notify
  
  * Multisampling
  
  * Multitexturing
  
  * Simple ray tracer
